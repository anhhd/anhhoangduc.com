<p>I remember 4 years back when I started writing master thesis in <code>Warsaw School of Economics</code>, I started to learn <code>LaTeX</code> and it was an amazing tool to write technical documents. However, to master <code>LaTeX</code> is not an easy job at all as it is quite tricky to solve various problems. To tell you the truth, since then I never ever used LateX again.</p>
<p>When started using <code>Rmarkdown</code> in 2016, it was very clear to me that <code>Rmarkdown</code> would be my favarite language to write any technical and non-technical documents. Since 2016, many new packages in <code>markdown</code> family have been borned and has helped statisticians, analysts around the world to write better &amp; easier. For blogging, we have fantastic <code>blogdown</code> (my 2 websites are written in blogdown). However, I haven’t tried using <code>bookdown</code> yet.</p>
<p>Now that I would like to write a book about practical data science with my experience and knowledge in Vietnamese, I started to use <code>bookdown</code> and try to write the book in Vietnamese. It sounds quite easy as there are many fantastic tutorial available online. However, to write a book in foreign language rather than English is not that easy if you do not know LaTeX.</p>
<p>In this blog, I want to share some simple but very effective tips to write a book with <code>bookdown</code> in foreign language in some simple steps.</p>

<div id="step-1-install-bookdown" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 1: Install bookdown</h3>
<p>Of course, it is the critical part to start to write a book with <code>bookdown</code>. You can install bookdown easily as follows.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;)</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<hr />

<div id="step-2-create-a-new-project-with-bookdown" class="section level3">
<h3>Step 2: Create a new project with bookdown</h3>
<p>After installing bookdown, you can easily create a new <code>book project</code> with bookdown from <code>RStudio</code>.</p>
<p><code>File &gt;&gt; New Project &gt;&gt; New bookproject using bookdown</code></p>
<p>After finishing this part, you already have had a standard, simple book to follow (of course, it is in English). So, the next steps are to change the contents into your desired language.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Read &amp; follow instruction from bookdown’s author</h3>
<p><code>Yihui</code> has written a great book about how to use <code>bookdown</code> efficiently. In this online book, there is a chapter which helps you to internationalize your book, or namely to write a book in other languages.</p>
<p>To do it, you can simply translate all parameters defined in bookdown into your language. The default translation of these parameters are as follows.</p>
<pre><code>language:
  label:
    fig: &#39;Figure &#39;
    tab: &#39;Table &#39;
    eq: &#39;Equation &#39;
    thm: &#39;Theorem &#39;
    lem: &#39;Lemma &#39;
    cor: &#39;Corollary &#39;
    prp: &#39;Proposition &#39;
    cnj: &#39;Conjecture &#39;
    def: &#39;Definition &#39;
    exm: &#39;Example &#39;
    exr: &#39;Exercise &#39;
    proof: &#39;Proof. &#39;
    remark: &#39;Remark. &#39;
    solution: &#39;Solution. &#39;
  ui:
    edit: Edit
    chapter_name: &#39;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>You can read all details in the following link <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/internationalization.html" class="uri">https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/internationalization.html</a>.</p>
<p>However, after translating above parameters, it works only in HTML version, not <code>pdf</code> one. I searched through the internet but it could not find any specific instruction.</p>
<p>The key thing here is to change the <code>preamble.tex</code> file in your project. The original <code>preamble</code> file is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>\usepackage{booktabs}</code></pre>
<p>To make the whole book translated into your desired language, you need to add 2 lines of codes as follows:</p>
<pre><code>\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage[vietnamese]{babel}</code></pre>
<p>If your language is <code>spanish</code>, feel free to change <code>vietnamese</code> to <code>spanish</code>. After changing, your book will work perfectly with all contents, parameters translated into your language.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hope that this tip could help <code>analysts</code> to use <code>bookdown</code> easier when writing a book in their own languages!</p>
