# About me

My name is Anh Hoang Duc, a Business Analytics professional from Hanoi, Vietnam. I have a background in Quantitative Methods in Economics & am a co-founder of [Ranalytics.vn](http://www.ranalytics.vn), a group of data-addicted R users specializing in data analytics with the dream to bring the power of R & analytics to Vietnam.  I am also an instructor of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/instructors/) & [Datacamp](http://www.goo.gl/RzGcmq) in Vietnam, providing various aspects of R such as data analysis, data wrangling, data vizualization or predictive modelling with R.

Currently, I am employed by [VPBank](https://www.vpbank.com.vn) as the head Advanced Analytics department in Business Inteligence Competency Center. My responsibility is to build a team with strong analytics capabilities to solve real business problems within the bank. The team has been applying various techniques to help the bank understand customers better and make better decisions, such as customer segmentation, preventing customer churn, building next best offers or analyzing marketing effectiveness.
