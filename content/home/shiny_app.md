Apart from my work, I really enjoy my time to create shiny apps to automate some common analysis problems for my team, some of them are as follows:

- [Market basket analysis](https://anhhoangduc.shinyapps.io/basket_analysis/): Recommendation engine based on customer behaviours 
using apriori algorithm
- [Customers segmentation with RFM](https://anhhoangduc.shinyapps.io/rfm_segmentation/): Cluster customers transaction behaviours
using RFM techniques (Recency - Frequency - Monetary)
- [Static to Dynamic SQLServer](https://anhhoangduc.shinyapps.io/static-sql/): Auto translate Static SQL to Dynamic SQL with parameters
