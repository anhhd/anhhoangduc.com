Apart from my work, I really enjoy my time to create shiny apps to automate some common analysis problems for my team, some of them are as follows:

- [Market basket analysis](https://anhhoangduc.shinyapps.io/basket_analysis/)
- [Customers segmentation with RFM](https://anhhoangduc.shinyapps.io/rfm_segmentation/)
