<p>The easiest way to install an R package is from R-Cran. However, as the number of R users is growing up very fast, many developers are contribute to R community through Github. And the standard way to install from Github is to use <code>devtools</code> package with <code>install_github()</code> command.</p>
<p>In many organization, especially financial organization like banking industry, sometimes it is very hard to install an R package from CRAN or Github due to security process. So, in this post I will share with you 2 ways to install an R package via proxy</p>
<div id="method-1-using-downloader-package" class="section level2">
<h2>Method 1: Using <code>downloader</code> package</h2>
<p>In this method, the only thing that you need to change is the Github repository of the R package needed to be installed.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to install package <code>easyRFM</code> from Github with the following link: <code>github.com/hoxo-m/easyRFM</code>, you can easily install with the following codes:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Step 1: Install downloader from CRAN
install.packages(&quot;downloader&quot;)
library(downloader)

#Step 2: Download R package from Github in format .tar.gz
download(&quot;https://github.com/hoxo-m/easyRFM/archive/master.tar.gz&quot;,
         &quot;easyRFM.tar.gz&quot;)

#Step 3: Install from source
install.packages(&quot;easyRFM.tar.gz&quot;, repos = NULL, type = &quot;source&quot;)</code></pre>

<div id="method-2-using-httr-package-to-modify-your-proxy" class="section level2">
<h2>Method 2: Using <code>httr</code> package to modify your proxy</h2>
<p>In this method, you can modify your proxy using <code>httr</code> package. To modify your proxy, the key function is <code>set_config</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>httr::set_config(use_proxy(&quot;your_proxy:your_port&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>For instance, if your proxy is <code>11.36.22.12</code> &amp; your port is <code>8080</code>, you can modify your proxy as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Step 1: Call httr &amp; devtools
library(httr)
library(devtools)

#Step 2: Modify proxy
set_config(use_proxy(&quot;11.36.22.12:8080&quot;))

#Step 3: Install package directly from Github
install_github(&quot;rstats-db/odbc&quot;)

#Step 4: Reset your proxy if needed
reset_config()</code></pre>
<p>Two methods above help me a lot to install R packages, specially from Github. Hope that it will help you also to make your life easier!</p>
