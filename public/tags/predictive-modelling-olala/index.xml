      <description>The challange Issueing credit cards is one of the main focuses of VPBank&amp;rsquo;s Retail Division, with a target of multi thousands new cards in 2017. However, there is little meaning in acquiring new card holders if they are going to churn in big numbers.
In 2016, attrition rate was very high for newly issued cards, posing a substantial problem. This calls for a need to identify potential attritors months before they make the action, enabling the Bank to take corrective measures to keep them from churning.</description>
