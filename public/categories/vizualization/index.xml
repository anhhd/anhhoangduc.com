      <description>In digital world, active users is very important metrics but is quite hard to descrile performance of a website/service overtime. Typically, the formula of active user at given time t can be describle as follows:
\[active_{t} = active_{t-1} + new_{t} - churn_{t}\]
Naturally, waterfall chart comes to my mind as an candidate to vizualize performance of active users overtime. So, I tried to look for some real case study using waterfall chart for this very problem using R but I was stuck.</description>
