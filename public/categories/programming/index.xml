      <description>In the life of an analyst, one have to spend much time on data exploratory analysis. When you have to repeat the task multiple times, you might need to write a function. For example, I often need to do an analysis between a numeric variable and a factor variable in the following process:
Compare statistics among groups (mean, median,…)Make an ANOVA model to compare mean among groupsDraw some chart to vizualize difference among groupsTo solve this problem, I create a function called compare_group as follows:</description>
