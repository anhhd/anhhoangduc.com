      <description>I remember 4 years back when I started writing master thesis in Warsaw School of Economics, I started to learn LaTeX and it was an amazing tool to write technical documents. However, to master LaTeX is not an easy job at all as it is quite tricky to solve various problems. To tell you the truth, since then I never ever used LateX again.
When started using Rmarkdown in 2016, it was very clear to me that Rmarkdown would be my favarite language to write any technical and non-technical documents.</description>
