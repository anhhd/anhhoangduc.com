      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing department has used service from a vender for email marketing, which was impossible to evaluate the real effect on customers behaviors as well as to get insights of marketing campaigns. The challenge is to be able to evaluate the effectiveness of each campaign to justify accordingly for better campaign&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project team applied data scraping methods in conjunction with Selenium web browser automation tool to extract email marketing data from external outsourced sources. After that, we performed data exploratory analysis to understand which messages were well-received, when customers reacted, and the respond patterns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 5 days of an email campaign’ sending date, Sales and Marketing staff can view conversion rates of that campaign based on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers’ response to the email marketing campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their corresponding internet banking behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-impact&#34;&gt;Business Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimated time saved from interdepartmental communication and individual report generation is 1248 working hours per year, which could be converted into a save of 150 million VND per year&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operation division wanted optimize ATM &amp;amp; branch location for the bank. The challenge is to identify customers locations to understand how location could affect customers behaviors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve the problem, the team crawed spatial data from Google Maps to identify the longitudes &amp;amp; latitudes of customers and their ATM/branch location when using the bank services. After that, the Operation division were able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the exact location of customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the distance from a customer to the branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate the effect of relocating a branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Analyze customer&#39;s description using text-mining</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most transactions from customers are fund transfer which are categorized as internal or external transfer and the bank cannot understand the purpose of fund transfer from customers as descriptions are messy and unstructured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to identify transaction purpose of affluent customers, we used text mining technique to define which words are most frequent in their financial transaction description. After that, keywords are divided into different transaction groups such as bond, securities, or booking hotel for further usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;business-impact&#34;&gt;Business Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using text-mining techniques, we have helped business understand customers much better by categorizing transactions of thousands customers into proper groups and offering these customers proper products accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predict credit card attrition</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challange&#34;&gt;The challange&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issueing credit cards is one of the main focuses of VPBank&amp;rsquo;s Retail Division, with a target of multi thousands new cards in 2017. However, there is little meaning in acquiring new card holders if they are going to churn in big numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, attrition rate was very high for newly issued cards, posing a substantial problem. 
This calls for a need to identify potential attritors months before they make the action, enabling the Bank to take corrective measures to keep them from churning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predictive problem belongs to the unbalanced classification category, one of the most difficult predictive models, with the monthly portion of attritors equalling to 2% of that of active cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final model was built using the &lt;strong&gt;Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)&lt;/strong&gt; method after &lt;strong&gt;tuning multi hyper-parameters&lt;/strong&gt;.
As a combination between gradient descent and ada boost, GBM is a method of machine learning which combines many different decision trees to produce a powerful predictive model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also used data manipulation methods and activity analysis to find insightful findings within the transaction and card information datasets, 
as well as build a customer profile that segments our customer base into 4 groups with distinctive between-group demographic and spending behaviors: 
&lt;strong&gt;Attritors, High Risk Users, Typical Users and High Frequency Users&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing the model in conjuction with the customer profile, the Analytics team was able to provide the Products team with a list of almost &lt;strong&gt;12K potential attritors&lt;/strong&gt; and their respective card closing probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made data-driven recommendations in regards of card policies, cross-selling programs and marketing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list was provided for the Products team and is in use for a trial 3-month &amp;ldquo;Happy Call&amp;rdquo; Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also propose many target plan regarding customers&#39; transacting behaviours
to maintain them with the bank, for instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The group of users that should be offered other product as the are misusing credit card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific number of tracsaction that each customers should have every one month &amp;amp; two months to make them to be loyal customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model is updated on quarterly basis to be able to detect credit card attritor more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one year utilizing predictive modelling and the power of analytics capabilities, attrition rate has reduced by 40%. The estimated Total Operating Income impact of keeping all customers from churning is at an approxiamated of multi billion VND.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working in BICC - VPBank, there are some common questions that a data science team has to solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could I find potential customers for a given product?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does it look like the frequent patterns of customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the retention rate/ cohort behaviour of customers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the customer behavior flows look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does one variable differ among various group?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and many other analytics questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve such problems, we created an R package named &lt;code&gt;VPBank&lt;/code&gt; with 30+ built-in functions so as to release time for data analytics team. The package has helped Analytics team in many perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce time to analyze data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standardize many analytics process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unify template and format of graphics from different team members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the package, it has saved many working days for analytics team and make analytics process much shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Search engines for data terms</title>
      <link>/project/search-engine/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When building the new Data Warehouse, we have to deal with various data sources to extract business/data terms which will be use later for business.
However, we face some fundamental but challenging questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could I know that a term/multiple terms have been developed in the new DWH?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could I find data terms effectively as we face problems of Natural Language Processing with Vietnamese language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve such problems, we built a search engine using &lt;code&gt;Natural Language Processing&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Shiny&lt;/code&gt; in IBM Watson platform. The app help us to have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple but modern interface for business users to find data available in the new DWH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effectve search engine which can identify multiple terms with propensity of accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the app, it has saved hundreds hours for users/project to search and communicate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SQL auto documentation</title>

      <guid>/project/sql-document/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34;&gt;The challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of daily jobs of a data analyst is to extract data from various sources in DWH to build a report for address business needs. 
However, when the number of data analysts as well as requests from business increase, there are some very difficult issues to solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could a new data analyst can catch up quickly with the team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could we separate business logics (usually as comments in SQL scripts) from SQL language so that the knowledge handover process can run smoothly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How could we identify fundamental of SQL scripts, such as input tables, output tables and variables, steps to run the job without creating separate documents?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All theses three issues become harder to solve when the scale of the team increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution&#34;&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve such problems, we build an &lt;code&gt;Shiny app&lt;/code&gt; which allows data analyst to upload a bundle of SQL scripts. The app will analyze and generate a beautiful HTML report which contains following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input tables, output tables and variables used in all scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document auto-generated from comments from all scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the solution, data analytics boost productivity by at least 10% by eliminating all the cost of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
