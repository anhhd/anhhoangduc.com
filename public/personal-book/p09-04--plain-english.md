# Plain English

> A writen communication is in plain language if its wording, structure, and design are so clear that the intended readers can easily i nd what they need, understand it, and use it.

"Plain English" là kỹ thuật viết tiếng Anh một cách đơn giản, mạch lạc và dùng những từ cơ bản để biểu đạt chính xác thông điệp muốn truyền tải. "Plain English" không có nghĩa là đánh đổi không sử dụng thuật ngữ phức tạp và chỉ sử dụng từ đơn giản. 

Phần lớn các sách được viết với ngôn ngữ để cho độ tuổi trung bình đọc sách (13!!!) có thể đọc được.

Xem một số ví dụ dưới đây.

> He was conveyed to his place of residence in an intoxicated condition
>
> > He was carried home drunk.

> In the event of an emergency evacuation of these premises should you require assistance to facilitate your evacuation would you please advise your host or reception  on  arrival.
>
> > Visitors: if there’s an emergency, will you need help to leave the building? If so, please tell reception or your host now.

**Quy tắc viết theo phong cách "plain english"**:

- Không sử dụng lối nói ẩn dụ
- Không sử dụng từ phức tạp nếu có thể dùng từ ngắn gọn và đơn giản
- Nếu có thể giảm bớt từ trong câu, hãy giảm
- Sử dụng thể chủ động thay cho bị động
- Không sử dụng từ chuyên môn nếu có thể dùng từ thông thường thay thế

## Viết câu ngắn gọn và viết đoạn rõ ràng

- Nên viết câu ngắn gọn chứa từ 15-20 từ

**Ví dụ**:

> While low demand for housing has resulted in demolition of dwellings that has blighted the Hayden Riverside area, a far greater impact on population has occurred as a result of houses becoming empty or under-occupied and, when combined with the relatively low spending power of the residents of the area, this has had a drastic ef ect on local services, for example retail outlets and transportation.

> > Not many people want to live at Hayden Riverside, so the area has been blighted by demolition. The population has dropped even further because houses have become empty or under-occupied. These problems—and the 
low spending power of the area’s residents—have badly af ected services like shops  and  transport.


> I understand that some doctors making night calls have been at acked in  recent months on the expectation that they were carrying drugs. Their  caution when visiting certain areas in the south of the city has been very exacting. It

## Sử dụng thể chủ động

Nên sử dụng thể chủ động trừ khi có lý do chính đáng để sử dụng thể bị động. Thể bị động thường được dùng trong học thuật, academic. Do đó, khi đi làm, nhiều người cố sử dụng thể bị động trong công việc. Tuy nhiên, việc này khiến cho nhiều thông tin không được mạch lạc trong quá trình truyền đạt.

### Sử dụng I & We trong báo cáo

Nhiều người cho rằng không nên sử dụng I hoặc We trong report (đặc biệt Academic) và sử dụng các từ như "the author", "the writer" hoặc các cụm bị động như "it is thougt", "it is felt".

Trong một số trường hợp, ta vẫn có thể sử dụng thể bị động như trường hợp sau.

>  We discussed the benefits of recycling nuclear waste by home-composting methods in paragraph 3. 
> 
> > Paragraph 3 discusses the benefits of recycling nuclear waste by home-composting methods. 

### Trường hợp nên sử dụng thể bị động

Ta nên sử dụng thể bị động trong 5 trường hợp sau:

- Nói giảm tránh ý thù địch.
- Tránh nói tác nhân gây ra hành động vì tác nhân đó không phù hợp hoặc quá rõ ràng trong bối cảnh. _‘Police were positioned on rooft ops around Turf Moor_
- Hướng trung tâm thông báo vào đối tượng chịu tác động. "_An
18-year-old girl has been arrested by police in connection with the Blankshire murders_"
- Tránh né trách nhiệm bằng cách bỏ qua người làm. _‘Regrett ably, your file has been lost._
- Giúp kết nối giữa thông tin cũ và thông tin mới ở đầu câu. Đây là chức năng rất quan trọng của thể bị động

>  Concern has been raised about arrangements for gaining immediate access to the chimney. Winch failure or the presence of debris between the platform edge and the chimney internal wall may necessitate access.

**Phân tích**:

- Chuyển ‘resolution’ thành động từ mạnh: ‘Th e committee resolved that’.
- Danh từ ‘study’ chuyển thành động từ ‘study’: ‘officials should study’.
- Danh từ ‘provision’ chuyển thành mệnh đề:
‘the feasibility of providing a skateboard park in the area’. 

>  Th e committee resolved that officials should study the feasibility of providing a skateboard park in the area

## Sử dụng list

>  The Moorside Plan is a new way of planning for the future of our area. It will set the framework within which we plan for the future and includes important choices about development within Moorside. It will provide us with a clear vision to guide development to 2016 and will promote measures to improve our economy, provide the homes we need, and protect our environment.

which will:
> > set the framework within which we plan for the future
> > include important choices about development in Moorside
> > give us a clear vision to guide development to 2016, and
> > promote measures to improve our economy, provide the homes we need, and protect our environment.

Tuy nhiên, việc sử dụng list gặp 3 vấn đề lớn:

- Tạo list ngang cấp (parallel list)
- Phân cách các nội dung của list
- Đánh số các nội dung

### Tạo các list ngang cấp

> To restrict your salt intake, you should:
>
> - not add salt at the table
> - use only a litt le salt in cooking
> - **do not** use bicarbonate of soda or baking powder in cooking
> - avoid salty food like tinned fi sh, roasted peanuts, olives. 

Trong ví dụ trên, item số 3 không thực sự ngang cấp với các item khác. Cách sửa như sau

> To restrict your salt intake, you should:
>
> - not add salt at the table
> - use only a litt le salt in cooking
> - not use bicarbonate of soda or baking powder in cooking
> - avoid salty food like tinned fi sh, roasted peanuts, olives. 

Tuy nhiên, version trên vẫn lẫn những điều làm và không nên làm. Ta có thể tạo version khác như sau.

> To restrict your salt intake, you should use only a litt le salt in cooking and you should not:
> 
> - add salt at the table
> - use bicarbonate of soda or baking powder in cooking, or
> - eat salty food like tinned fi sh, roasted peanuts, and olives.  

**Lưu ý**: List chỉ dễ đọc khi có cấu trúc ngữ phap tương tự nhau. Do đó, khi viết, cần lưu ý điểm này

>  The inspector should check that:
>
> - the vehicle **is properly marked** with hazard plates
> - the engine and cab heater **are switched off** during the unloading of explosives and
> - any tobacco or cigarettes **are kept** in a suitable container or cigarette lighters **are not being kept** in the cab and
> - the explosives **are securely stowed**

Khi các items không được viết cùng dạng ngữ pháp, sẽ khiến người đọc khó theo dõi hơn

> When the committee began work, it established the following aims:
>
> - make the regulations simple to understand and up to date in structure and layout
> - to update forms, leafl ets, and the website where necessary with details of current fees
> - the effects of competition will be considered
> - the creation of a document summarizing details of the regulations, which will enable people to focus on key issues and requirements
> - recent changes in legislation should be taken into account. 
>

### Phân cách các nội dung trong list

>  The new job-holder will:
>
> - develop a set of guidelines for clean wastepaper recycling
> Introduce green bins for clean wastepaper at appropriate places;
> monitor compliance with departmental targets. 

**Lỗi**: Item số 2 bắt đầu với viết hoa và kết thúc bằng dấu ;

**Lưu ý 1**: Đối với các items thể hiện sự liên kết, mang tính liệt kê, bổ trợ, ta cần:

- Bắt đầu list với viết thường
- Kết thúc mỗi gạch đầu dòng không để dấu
- Item cuối cùng kết thúc bời dấu chấm.

> The new job-holder will:
>
> - develop a set of guidelines for clean wastepaper recycling
> - introduce green bins for clean wastepaper at appropriate places
> - monitor compliance with departmental targets.

---

**Lưu ý 2**: Đối với các list mà mỗi ý thể hiện các câu độc lập, ta có thể:

- bắt đầu bằng viết hoa, và
- kết thúc mỗi câu với dấu chấm.

>  The speaker made three points:
>
> - Aboriginal people across the world have been persecuted in the name of civilization and religion.
> - Even so-called enlightened governments have broken treaties made in good faith by aboriginals.
> - Despair among aboriginals will lead either to their cultural disintegration or uprisings against authority. 

### Đánh số các items

Không cần đánh số các items, có thể sử dụng gạch đầu dòng hoặc (a), (b), (c)

> Maintenance grants when studying abroad
>
> _Students of modern languages_.
>
> A student of modern languages is defined by the regulations as a student whose course ‘includes the study of one or more modern languages other than English for not less than half of the time spent studying the course and which includes periods of residence in a country whose language is a main language of the course’

> > - periods of residence in a country whose language is a main language of the course

## Chuyển tiêu cực thành tích cực

Khi người đọc nhận thức thông tin tiêu cực, quá trình tư duy sẽ diễn ra như sau:

- Tìm và hiểu ý tích cực
- Loại bỏ ý tích cực để hiểu ý tiêu cực

Các từ tiêu cực là các từ chứa "un", "avoid", "undo",...

> Vote for not more than one candidate. 
>
> > Vote for one candidate only.

> ‘Dependent relative’ includes a member’s child or adopted child who **has not attained** the age of 18 or has **not ceased** to receive full-time education or training.

>
> > This Regulation does not amend or seek to amend national legislation on access to documents. Yet the principle of loyal cooperation that governs relations between the institutions and the Member States means that Member
States should:

> > (b) respect the security rules of the institutions. 

> Do not switch on the power unless you have made all the necessary checks 
>

> 
> The girls who will join the team next week, are fine players for their age. 

> They crept into the room and found the body
> 
> They crept into the room, and found the body

**Lưu ý**: 

- Chỉ sử dụng dấu phẩy trước "and" khi hai câu là độc lập về ý.

> It's cold outside, and I can't find my coat.

- Khi hai câu có quan hệ, không có dấu phẩy trước and

> He tossed the ball, and watched the dog chase it
>
> Câu này sai vì "watched the dog chase it" không thể đứng độc lập một mình.

### Dấu chấm phẩy

> The problem is tidal flooding along the river. Many plans have been studied but the agreed solution is a system of river matt ressing (to avoid breaches) and embankment raising (to avoid exceptionally high-tide flooding). 

## Các nhận định sai lầm khi viết câu

### Không bắt đầu với "But"

Ta hoàn toàn có thể bắt đầu với "but" ở đầu câu.

> But of course you can start an editorial with a “but”. But us no buts. The Bible is full of the usage. But the taboo against it is a lingering superstition, dreamed up by prescriptive Victorian grammarians who tried to make English run on railway lines instead of an open road. 

### Không có dấu phẩy trước "and"

Như đã giải thích ở phần trước, ta hoàn toàn có thể có dấu phẩy trước and

> It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen
>
> (First line of Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four ) 

### Không kết thúc câu với giới từ

>  I can only imagine that Saddam needed that clock to stare at

### Không ngắt to với động từ nguyên thể có to

Loại này trong ngôn ngữ là động từ chẻ đôi dùng để nhấn, hoàn toàn có thể dùng để nhấn ý trong câu

> The passengers were asked to __carefully__ get down from the train. 

> The most diligent search can find no modern grammarian to pedantically, to dogmatically, to invariably condemn a split infinitive. Rules are created to aid the communication of meaning. In the cause of meaning they can sometimes be broken. 

## Loại bỏ lối nói màu mè

- Sử dụng các danh từ trung tính

### Sử dụng tên hoặc "he or she"

> Solvent abuse is not a crime but if a police officer finds a young person under 17 sniffing solvents, he should take him to a secure place such as a police station, home, or hospital. 
> 
> > Solvent abuse is not a crime but if a police officer finds a young person under 17 sniffing solvents, __the officer__ (__he or she__) should take __the person__ to a secure place such as a police station, home, or hospital. 
>
> > Sử dụng số nhiều
> >
> > Solvent abuse is not a crime but if __police officers__ find a person under 17 sniffing solvents, they should take the person to a secure place such as the person’s home, a police station, or a hospital.

## Viết đầu email

### Không viết đầy đủ

> Further to your letter of 3 February concerning the trustees of the P F Smith 1982 Settlement.
>
> > Further to your letter of 3 February concerning the trustees of the P F Smith
1982 Sett lement, I am pleased to enclose the form you requested. 
>

## Case study

### Case study 1

> Dear Retailer
>
> As a valued customer, for Cockerel Brothers. We would like to assure you of our continual monitering for anything which could affect the quality of our fresh eggs.
>
>  Cockerels have just undertook a survey of all our feed mills which involved testing fi nished feeds and samples (scrappings) from the mills, and having them tested by the Public Health Laboratory. This has resulted in a programme
of mill monitering to prevent any bacterial build-up in our mills. We do not use any raw poultry offal meat, and dried poultry manure in our mills. We are taking these precautions to endevour our feed is as free from harmful
bacteria, as is humanly possible, and manufactured from only wholesome raw materials. 

**Phân tích**:

- Câu đầu không trọn vẹn, thậm chí đưa ra ý là người viết là khách hàng 
- Sai ngữ pháp và chính tả: monitering - monitoring, undertook - undertaken
- Dấu phẩy sau **meat** và **bacteria** sai

> Dear Customer
>
> • Our eggs are fresh and healthy.

# Plain English at work

## Giới thiệu

Plain English bao gồm 3 cấu phần:

- Phong cách: Viết như cách chúng ta nói. Đây là vấn đề *tricky* nhất của plain English vì phần lớn các sách hướng dẫn viết đều nhấn mạnh sự khác biệt giữa văn nói và văn viết. Tuy nhiên, nếu thành thạo được thì kỹ thuật này sẽ rất mạnh và có thể áp dụng mọi trường hợp
- Tổ chức: Luôn bắt đầu với ý chính (trung tâm thông báo) trước, nhưng ko nhất thiết phải luôn là câu đầu tiên trong đoạn
- Cấu trúc: Sử dụng heading, bullets,... để giúp người đọc nắm bắt dễ dàng nội dung hơn.

> Những người viết hay thường dùng những từ cơ bản, thông dụng nhất. Trong khi đó, những người viết không tốt luôn cố gắng tìm những từ *đao to, búa lớn* để tạo ấn tượng với độc giả.

### Phong cách

> Write the way you talk

**Nguyên tắc**: Tưởng tượng đang nói chuyện trước đám đông/điện thoại về nội dung cần viết. Nói cái gì, viết cái đấy. 

#### Sử dụng các từ đơn giản

- Sử dụng các từ thông thường: before thay cho prior to, tell thay cho advise, help thay cho assist, etc.
- Sử dụng từ đơn giản không có nghĩa là viết văn giống trẻ con mà thậm chí, những bài viết tốt nhất, có thể được viết chỉ bằng những từ đơn giản. Xem ví dụ dưới đây.

> At the age of eighty my mother had her las bad fall, and after that her mind wandered free through time. Some days she wnet to weddings and funerals that had taken place half a century earlier. On others she presided over family dinners cooked on Sunday afternoons for children who were now gray at age. Through all this, she lay in bed but moved across time, travelling among the dead decades with a speed and an ease beyond the gift of phisical science.

#### Sử dụng các dâu ngắt

Khi diễn thuyết, các diễn giả giỏi bên cạnh nội dụng và lời nói, còn phải sử dụng cử chỉ, ngôn ngữ cơ thể để biểu đạt các nội dung cần truyền tải tốt hơn. Tương tự, khi viết, ta cần sử dụng các dấu khác nhau, không chỉ là dấu chấm và dấu phẩy, để có thể viết một cách hiệu quả.

Một trong những cách hiệu quả nhất để viết và tập trung sự chú ý của người đọc là sử dụng dấu hỏi chấm. Dấu hỏi có tác dụng thu hút sự chú ý cũng như giúp người đọc hiểu hơn về trọng tâm mà ta muốn biểu đạt.

> The main poin is that the defective computer disks are not the responsibility of the manufacturer, as we first suspected, but of the wholesaler, who stored them at a 130 degree temperature.
>
> > Just who is responsible for the defective computer disks? Is it the manufacturer, as we first suspected? No. The *wholesaler* is responsible - he stored them at a 130 degree temperature.

#### Sử dụng đại từ

Khi viết, nên sử dụng nhiều đại từ và thể chủ động, điều này sẽ khiến câu văn trở nên mạch lạc và rõ ràng hơn rất nhiều.

> The monitor must first be turned on and then the computer must be turned on. A menu with the ...
>
> > First, turn on your monitor. Then turn on your computer. You 'll then find a menu with...

#### Sử dụng form ngắn gọn, viết tắt

Trong plain English, ta có thể dùng các cách viết tắt như: we 'll, we 're, etc.

### Tổ chức

> Luôn bắt đầu với ý chính trước.

Cách viết này là cách viết diễn dịch. So với cách viết quy nạp, cách viết này có các ưu điểm sau:

- Người đọc dễ dàng nắm được nội dung chính của cả bài viết
- Hiểu rõ hơn các luận điểm mà tác giã muốn thể hiện để bổ trợ cho ý chính đấy.

**Case study**: Khi viết email, bắt đầu với điều mà mình mong muốn người đọc làm.

> Dear Max
>
> On December 15, I received a phone call from Mr. Jason Brown from Michigan, who was your director of sailig in Saginaw School. Mr. Brown who recently had a fine interview with us, has requested I contact you. He requests a letter of verification of employment, including confirmation of his job title and the duties he performed while in your school. Accordig to Mr. Brown, he needs this to apply for a similar position in the Caribbean.
>
> I would appreciate your help in this matter
> 
> > Dear Max
> >
> > Would you verify the employment of Mr. Jason Brown?
> >
> > Mr. Brown was your director of sailing...


### Cấu trúc

- Sủ dụng heading (tiêu đề) để làm nổi rõ ý
- SỬ dụng các gạch đầu dòng khi liệt kê

### Kỹ thuật viết

Cách thức đơn giản để có thể viết hiệu quả có thể thực hiện trong 3 bước

- Bắt đầu với ý chính
- Chia các nội dung cần viết thành các đoạn
- Đặt tiêu đề (headings) cho các đoạn
- Băt đầu mỗi đoạn với ý chính
- Nếu cần các thông tin chi tiết, chia thành các bullet points

Kỹ thuật viết trên rất hiệu quả trong công việc, khi mà mọi người đều muốn nắm được thông tin càng nhanh chóng, càng chính xác càng tốt. Vi dụ memo dưới đây.

> This memo asks for your authorization to rent three computers for $900 total cost
>
> We 've ordered three personal computers to work on the Laredo project, but the supplier can't get them to us until June 1. Because we must start the project sooner, we need to rent other computers in the meantime. This memo gives you the details
>
> **Why are our new computers late?**
>
> The manufacturer had trouble with defective computer chips. As a result...

## Phong cách viết (styles)

### Tránh dùng thể bị động

Chỉ nên dùng thể bị động khi thật cần thiết. 

> When a computer file has been created, it must be moved to the remote node
>
> > When a user creates a computer, the system must move it to the remote node.

Khi nào nên dùng thể bị động?

- Khi ta cố tình dấu tác nhân gây ra hành động.

> I have decided everybody must work this weekend
> 
> > It has been determined ~by me~ that you must work this weekend

- Khi ta không biết tác nhân gây hành động. John was murdered
- Khi ta nhấn trung tâm thông báo vào đối tượng nhận hành động. *What happened to the girl? The girl was rescued*

### Tránh viết lập lờ (abstractness), viết đúng trọng tâm (concrete)

**Nguyên tắc**: Không để người đọc phải đoán ý. Khi viết câu phải trúng nội dung muốn thể hiện

> As a property manager, I sometimes find strange things.

**Lỗi**: Rất nhiều thứ có thể *strange*. Trong câu này, người đọc phải cố đoán *strange* nghĩa là gì

Câu trên có thể chuyển thành đúng trọng tâm bằng cách thêm ví dụ như sau.

> As a property manager, I sometimes find strange things. At one property, I found two people living in an electrical room....

Có 3 cách để viết trúng và đúng nội dung cần biểu đạt:

- Sử dụng ví dụ
- Kể chuyện ngắn
- Làm phép so sánh

#### Sử dụng ví dụ

> As a loan officer, I will not hesitate to hold up an application of a member whose salary I question. For example, I would be suspicious of someone who is eighteen and make $50,000

> I am responsible for making sure the computer system is running smoothly every day. If there are any problems - such as a database running out of space - I am called to fix it.

#### Kể chuyện ngắn

#### Làm phép so sánh

Những người viết giỏi dùng rất nhiều phép so sánh.

> Functions of BIC & Finance are like the accelerator & the brake of a motorbike. BIC is the accelerator who will help business to speed up to meet their target. However, Finance is the brake who will keep the whole company safe when moving too fast.

### Dùng các dấu ngắt

Sử dụng các dấu ngắt sẽ có tác dụng làm cho câu trở nên mạch lạc, có trọng tâm hơn.

#### Dấu hai chấm (colon)

Dấu hai chấm được dùng trong các trường hợp sau.

- Chỉ một từ: He started the business for one reason: money
- Chỉ một list: He started the business for three reasons: adventure, fame, and money
- Chỉ một câu hoàn chỉnh: He had always been a thrill-seeker: he once climbed the northwest face of Dorne
- Chỉ một nhóm các câu: He started the business for three reasons: He wanted adventure. He wanted fame. He wanted money.

#### Dấu gạch ngang dài (dash)

- Dùng tương tự như dấu hai chấm: He started business for one reason - money
- Dùng hai dấu để thê hiện thêm thông tin: He robbed the bank - the one just around the corner - for the sheer adventure.
- Dùng một dấu để nhấn nội dung cuối trong câu. He robbed the bank - for adventure.

#### Dấu chấm phẩy (semicolon)

- Dùng để nối hai câu độc lập nhưng có liên quan chặt chẽ đến nhau.

> In spring, the blossoms are beautiful on the apple trees; in autumn, the apples are a nuisance on the lawn.

- Dùng trong list khi trong list lại có dấu phẩy

> Many stars from the carnival were there: the ringmaster; Hapro and Groucho, the clowns; Feline, the lion tamer.

## Blueprint

**Nguyên tắc**: Nói với người đọc cấu trúc của bài viết trước. Kỹ thuật này đặc biệt hữu dụng với các bài viết dài (quá 1 trang). Với các bài viết ngắn, không nhất thiết phải có blueprint

> From my point of view, we may classify risks as:
> 
> - noncommercial
> - political
> - financial
> 
> Let's look more closely at these


**Kỹ thuật viết blueprint**:

- Blueprint sử dụng như nội dung chính cần highlight
- Sau khi liệt kê các nội dung, viết thêm 1 câu chốt. VD: Let's examine each step in detail.
- Heading và nội dung trong blueprint phải khớp nhau

## Executive summary

Khi viết report trong kinh doanh, executives summary là phần đặc biệt quan trọng, giúp người đọc nắm bắt được các nội dung chủ yếu, đặc biệt phù hợp với các sếp không có thời gian chi tiết. Các lưu ý khi viết executive summary:

- Nội dung quan trọng nhất của report cần được đưa lên đầu
- Phần giữa của summary cần đảm bảo yếu tố *skimmable*, nên dùng headings & bullets
- Phần cuối của summary cần giải thích cấu trúc của report
- Không được quá đơn giản vì sẽ không nắm được hết ý của report
- Không dùng các từ chuyên ngành

**Bad summary**

This report recommends ways to buy our shoes. These are the sources the report considers:

- catalogs
- sales calls
- shows
- visit to wholesalers

The report examines each of these in detail and then makes a recommendation.

**Good summary**

**Main recommendation**

This report recommends we buy most of our shoes from  wholesalers during visits to the wholesalers' warehouses.

**The problem**

Now we buy shoes from the following sources:

- catalogs
- sales calls
- shows
- visit to wholesalers

The result? Too often we have shoes cluttering our store - shoes in strange colors, styles, and sizes that we have troble selling. Worse, we often do not have the right colors, styles, and sizes to make sales.

That's why I recommend visiting wholesalers. That way, we can see the actual colors & styles we purchase, and we can check for quality and fit. Then we won't be stuck with shoes we can't sell.

**What this report covers**

In this report, I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each way we buy shoes. And then I explain why the last way - visits to wholesalers - is better than each of the other ways.
